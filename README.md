# Universal-Bank-SVM
This repository contains a machine learning project that utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification. The dataset used in this project includes information about individuals, such as age, income, and credit card usage, with the goal of predicting whether they accept a personal loan offer (1) or not (0).

## Data Exploration:
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset.
Preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and scaling features. Visualization is also done using scatter plots & heatmaps.

* Model Development:
Building and training an SVM model for binary classification.
Evaluating the model's performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics.

* Model Comparison: 
Comparing the SVM model with different kernels (linear, polynomial, radial basis function - rbf and sigmoid) for classification.
Visualizing and interpreting the results.

* Data Files:
UniversalBank.csv: The original dataset used in the project.

* Results:
The SVM model achieved an accuracy of approximately 75% on the test set.
Model performance was compared with different kernel functions, demonstrating the impact on precision, recall, and F1-score.
